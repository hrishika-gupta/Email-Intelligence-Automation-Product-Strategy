# ðŸ“¬ Email Intelligence Automation with Python

A Python-based pipeline built to process and analyze 7,000+ `.eml` client inquiry emails for product insight discovery at Afforest. This tool helped automate lead data extraction and convert unstructured email content into actionable insights for product development and sales strategy.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

During my internship at Afforest, I was tasked with uncovering key patterns and regions of interest within 7,000+ inbound email queries received by the team. These emails were crucial for informing the design of future products but were trapped in `.eml` files with no structured access.

To solve this, I built a **complete automation pipeline** that:
- Extracts email metadata (sender, date, subject)
- Parses and cleans full body content
- Detects and validates **phone numbers** using `phonenumbers`
- Identifies **locations** via Named Entity Recognition (`spaCy`)
- Compiles all insights into a clean, analyzable `.csv` format

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- `Python 3.10+`
- `email` (standard library)
- `re` (regex)
- `phonenumbers`
- `spaCy` (`en_core_web_sm`)
- `csv`
- `.eml` file parsing

## ðŸ§  Key Features

âœ… Parse `.eml` email files  
âœ… Extract sender name, email, subject, date  
âœ… Clean + extract full plain-text email body  
âœ… Detect and validate global-format phone numbers  
âœ… Use `spaCy` NER to extract locations (cities, countries)  
âœ… Export clean structured data into `.csv`
